    description: 'AK-47 is one of the world’s top strains and a favorite for many. There is hardly a smoker or cannabis grower who doesn’t know about this legendary strain. The sativa-dominant AK-47 as we know now was created by Simon from Serious Seeds in 1992. Its origin goes back much further to the 70s where it probably begun as a cross between Thai and Afghani. In 1999, AK-47 was re-crossed so it produced more uniform seeds.Some may wonder where AK-47 got its name from. The strain is named after the famous Russian Kalashnikov rifle, but not so much because it would be a “violent” strain. Its high, while very powerful is actually very balanced. The strain got this name since it can literally knock out some less experienced smokers with just one hit. Thats why Simon gave this strain the nickname "One Hit Wonder". AK-47 is one of the most awarded cannabis strains in history. It has won many Cannabis Cup awards thanks to its very high THC content of more than 20%. You can find it on many lists of recommended “Top Cannabis Strains" as the strain that every grower and smoker should at least try once.'

Ask some knowledgeable folks and they will likely tell you that the incredibly potent GG is possibly one of the best hybrids strains that you can grow today – and who’d want to argue? Now let’s take all the GG goodness that has the cannabis world raving like crazy, let’s add autoflowering genetics and what we get is an autoflower that’s nothing short of amazing! GG will make your mouth water when you get a wiff of her resin-covered buds with their superb pine and sour aromas that she got from her parents. But the “Glue” part in her name doesn’t just stand for her crazy resin production (of course, that’s already great on its own!) but can also stand for her cheerful and very positive effect which is a nice mix of Sativa and Indica, uplifting and relaxing at the same time.'

    description: 'Thai refers to a cannabis variety that grows natively in Thailand and was brought to the U.S. in the 70s and 80s. This pure sativa landrace is sometimes called “Thai Sticks” because of the way its buds are traditionally dried and tied into long sticks. This original Thai variety has given rise to many strains we commonly see on the market today, including Voodoo, Juicy Fruit, and the classic Haze. Thai induces powerful but comfortable effects and has a distinct fruity, citrus aroma. This strain is a challenge for growers outside tropical climates, but greenhouse gardens make this grow possible for experts patient enough for Thai’s long growth cycle and slow flowering.'
